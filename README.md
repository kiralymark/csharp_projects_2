try catch and finally test,
throw an exception

#### Summary:  
This program demonstrates exception handling in C#.
The Main method prompts the user to enter their age, attempts to convert it to an integer, and demonstrates exception handling with try, catch, and finally blocks.
  
The try block contains code that may throw an exception.
Read input from the console and attempt to convert it to an integer.
If text is used, it will throw an exception.

This test program demonstrates the usage of base keyword and abstract classes.


## ConsoleAppFizzBuzz

FizzBuzz task

#### Summary:  
This C# program implements a variation of the FizzBuzz problem. It accepts a user-inputted integer n and prints odd numbers from 1 to n.  
The program applies the following rules:  
- If a number is a multiple of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead.
- If a number is a multiple of 5, it prints "Buzz" instead.
- If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
- Otherwise, it prints the number itself.
  
The for loop iterates from 1 to n, skipping even numbers (iterateNumber += 2).

Task 1/3 (Array Rotation, modified task):  
The C# program allows users to swap two elements in an array. The user specifies two index positions, and the program swaps the values at those positions. The goal is to demonstrate basic array manipulation and swapping techniques. 
ArrayList is used in this task. The values are swapped using a temporary variable. 
  
Task 2/3 (Two Sum Problem, modified task):  
The program solves a variation of the Two Sum Problem. The user selects two indices from a predefined list, and the program adds the values at those indices, displaying the sum. 
  
Task 3/3 (Reverse the order in an array):  
The program reverses an ordered list. It takes a predefined list, creates a new list in reverse order, and prints both lists. 
The program loops through the original list in reverse order. Each value is copied into a new ArrayList. 

  
## ConsoleAppPalindromProgram

Palindrom Program,
string manipulation, 
string interpolation

#### Summary:  
This program checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward, such as "madam" or "121". 
  
How It Works:
- The program iterates through the string in reverse order.
- A new string is built by appending characters from the end of the input string.
- The original string is compared with the reversed string.
- If both are equal, it is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.

  
## ConsoleAppStringCheckProgram

check a String,
list of banned words,
  
#### Summary:  
This program checks if a given input string contains any banned words.  
If the input matches a banned word exactly, it triggers a censorship warning.  
If no banned words are detected, the input is displayed as it is.
