.NET Framework,

#### Summary:  
This C# program implements a variation of the FizzBuzz problem. It accepts a user-inputted integer n and prints odd numbers from 1 to n.  
The program applies the following rules:  
- If a number is a multiple of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead.
- If a number is a multiple of 5, it prints "Buzz" instead.
- If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
- Otherwise, it prints the number itself.
  
The for loop iterates from 1 to n, skipping even numbers (iterateNumber += 2).
